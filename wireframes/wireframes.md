## Wireframes ##

I used hand drawn wireframes in order to have get a rough sense of design for the all the pages that I have used. A sample section of the pages has been completed, with both Desktop and Responsive layouts, many of the pages are along the same design as the ones included here, such as all appeals and my organisation also register is much the same as register org and create appeal and  payments page. I deemed duplication was unnecessary for the purposes of design.

See the [wireframes](https://github.com/michael-leese/charityfund/tree/master/wireframes).

I have also created a rough relational diagram of the models that will be used in the database.
